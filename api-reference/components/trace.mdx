title: '<trace />'
---

A trace establishes a connection between two or more ports in both the schematic and PCB. Once a trace is completed, the auto-routing feature of your layout engine will attempt to route the connection between the ports in both the schematic and the PCB.

## Example Usage

```tsx
export default () => (
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
    <resistor
      resistance="1k"
      footprint="0402"
      name="R1"
      schX={3}
      pcbX={3}
    />
    <capacitor
      capacitance="1000pF"
      footprint="0402"
      name="C1"
      schX={-3}
      pcbX={-3}
    />
    <trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to=".C1 > .pin1" />
  </board>
)
