:::info
  We recommend experimenting with tscircuit from [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com), just go to the top and hit "New", no sign up required!

  Our CLI is a bit out of date- but we're working on it!
:::

## Install tscircuit

Install tscircuit using [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager)

```bash
npm install -g tscircuit tsx
```

You will now have the `tsci` command available. Try running `tsci --help` to see
some of what's available! We've also [installed the typescript runner `tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx)

## Initializing a Circuit

{/* <AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
your docs content. You can find this repository on our
[dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
locally, follow these
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
in your terminal.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
[Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
`mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup> */}

1. Create a new directory for your circuit then navigate to it in your terminal

2. Now run `tsci init`, this will bootstrap the directory into a usable project

Your bootstrapped project will look like this:

```
├── README.md
├── examples
│   └── MyExample.tsx
├── index.ts
├── lib
│   └── MyCircuit.tsx
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

The most important files are `MyCircuit.tsx` and `MyExample.tsx`.

In tscircuit, every file in the examples directory is accessible from your preview window and
will be shown on the registry. You can add variations of your circuit to
`MyExample.tsx` add other files in the `examples` directory and they will be
shown in the preview window.

In the `lib` directory, the `MyCircuit.tsx` file defines a boilerplate circuit.
You can rename and modify this file to test out different circuits.

```tsx title="MyCircuit.tsx"
  export const MyCircuit = () => (
    <resistor
      resistance="10kohm"
      name="R1"
      footprint="0805"
    />
  )
```

```tsx title="MyExample.tsx"
  import { MyCircuit } from "lib/MyCircuit"

  export const MyExample = () => (
    <MyCircuit />
  )
```

## Developing with Realtime Preview

To start the development server, run `tsci dev` in your terminal. This will open
a new browser window at [`localhost:3020`](http://localhost:3020) with a Schematic and PCB preview of a circuit in your
`examples` directory.

{/* <AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
[Commit and push your changes to
Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>

## Editing in VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  has Typescript and React support out
of the box, and the `tsconfig.json` file is set up to load types from `tscircuit`,
so there's nothing to configure!

## Build something!

Now that you know the basics, you can get started building circuits!
