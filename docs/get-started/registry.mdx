## What is the tscircuit registry?

The [tscircuit registry](https://tscircuit.com/trending) is a central registry of
re-usable components. You can publish (privately or publicly) your components to
re-use across projects.

## Why are re-usable components so important?

Small errors in the construction of a circuit can often lead to the
entire circuit not functioning. Re-using components helps to reduce
the risk of errors, since each sub-component can be independently
evaluated to function.

You should create and test sub-components to create a set of components
that will help you prototype more complex circuits rapidly. It doesn't make
sense to re-design and re-route a common set of components (such as a power
regulator and adaptor) for every project.

## npm-compatible

The tscircuit registry is npm-compatible. If you'd prefer to use npm's private
registry features, just publish using the regular `npm publish` command.
