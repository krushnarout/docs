## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple USB-powered LED circuit using the tscircuit snippets editor. 
When completed, you'll have a circuit that lights up an LED when a button is pressed.

## Creating the Circuit

Open [snippets.tscircuit.com](https://snippets.tscircuit.com) and create a new snippet.

First, we'll import our required components using module imports:
- @tsci/seveibar.red-led
- @tsci/seveibar.push-button
- @tsci/seveibar.smd-usb-c

Let's build our circuit by connecting the components.
Each component is positioned using `schX` and `schY` for schematic placement, `pcbY` and `pcbX` for PCB layout.
The traces use the format `.ComponentName > .pinName`.

This is the code used in the example:

```tsx
import { useRedLed } from "@tsci/seveibar.red-led"
import { usePushButton } from "@tsci/seveibar.push-button"
import { useUsbC } from "@tsci/seveibar.smd-usb-c"

export default () => {
  const USBC = useUsbC("USBC")
  const Button = usePushButton("SW1")
  const Led = useRedLed("LED")
  return (
    <board width="12mm" height="30mm">
      <USBC GND="net.GND" pcbY={-10} VBUS="net.VBUS" />
      <Led neg="net.GND" pcbY={12} schX={-10} schY={0} schRotation={"90deg"}/>
      <Button pcbY={0} pin2=".R1 > .pos" pin3="net.VBUS" schX={-4} schY={0}/>
      <resistor name="R1" footprint="0603" resistance="1k" pcbY={7} schX={-7} schY={-2} schRotation={90} supplierPartNumbers={{
        jlcpcb: ["C22548"]
      }} />
      <trace from=".R1 > .neg" to={Led.pos} />
    </board>
  )
}
```

Click "Run" to see your circuit. You can switch between different views:

Switch to the PCB view to see the physical layout:

## Understanding the Circuit

Let's break down the key parts:

1. **USB-C Power**: The `<USBC />` component provides power (VBUS) and ground (GND)
2. **Button**: The `<Button />` connects VBUS to the LED circuit when pressed
3. **Current Limiting**: The 1kÎ© resistor protects the LED from too much current
4. **LED**: Lights up when the button completes the circuit

## Exporting Your Design

You can export your design in various formats:
- Gerber files for PCB manufacturing
- KiCad format for further editing
- STEP files for mechanical design

Click the "Export" button and choose your desired format.

## Next Steps

Try modifying the design:
- Change the LED color by using a different LED component
- Adjust the board dimensions
- Add more buttons or LEDs
- Import different components using the `@` picker

Remember to save your snippet if you want to share it or use it in other projects!
